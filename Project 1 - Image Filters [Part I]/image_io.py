"""Utility class to help users read/write image files to a
directory. Modified by Alex Krentsel for Fall 2021's iteration of CSCI100 at Howard University."""
from PIL import Image

def read_file(filepath):
    """
    Read file at file path and return a matrix where the first
    dimension is the vertical and the second dimension is the
    horizontal. Each pixel is represented by a list of 3 integers
    representing the red, green and blue scale.

    For instance, imagine you have a 3x2 black and white image that
    makes a "V" shape. This code would return:

    [ [[255, 255, 255], [  0,   0,   0], [255, 255, 255]],
      [   0,   0,   0], [255, 255, 255], [  0,   0,   0]]

    PIL defaults to making the Coordinate system where the
    horizontal is the first dimension and the vertial is the second
    dimension. Source: https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/latest
    /handbook/concepts.html#coordinate-system.

    Parameters:
    filepath: {str} the relative path to the file to open

    Returns an image matrix as described above.
